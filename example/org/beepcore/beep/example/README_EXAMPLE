beepcore-java 0.9 examples
--------------------------

This package includes sample beep applications which use the
beepcore-java library. Beepd is a generic listener which can load any
profile that supports the Profile interface. beepd-config.xml is a
sample configuration file for Beepd. Bing is an initiator which pings
a beep listener using the EchoProfile.

Requirements
------------

Beepd requires a XML parser that implements the hasAttribute method for
the org.w3c.dom.Element class. Xerces is the library we use for our
development and testing.
