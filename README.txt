beepcore-java 0.9 release
---------------------

This release includes an implementation of beep core RFC 3080 and beep
mapping for TCP RFC 3081.

JDK Version notes
-----------------

beepcore-java supports Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) v1.2.x or
higher. The main reason for this is the use of the collections
classes.

Requirements
------------

The core package of the library is requires a XML parser that supports
the javax.xml.parsers, org.w3c.dom, and org.xml.sax interfaces. Xerces
is the library we use for most of our work but it has been tested with
others.

The profile TLS package requires the JSSE library.

Build
-----

To build the library we are using ANT (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/)
with the build.xml file in the root of the tree. The build.xml file is
lacking all of the dependencies, these will be added in the near
future.

Known Issues
------------

The TCL version and the Java version have an incompatibility.  The
temporary work around is to import the certifcate generated by
etc/makeCert (in the TCL library) into your Java certificate store
cacerts.  This is possible using keytool to import the server.pem file
from the TCL library.  See the keytool documentation for instructions
on how to import a certifcate.  The server.pem file is an X.509 format
certificate.
